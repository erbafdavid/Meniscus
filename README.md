# Meniscus

This despository was created to share a Matlab program which I created in 2014-2015
to construct equilibrium shapes of axisymmetric free surface problems using continuation method.
(pending drops, attached bubbles, sessile drops, etc, all geometries generically called menisci) 

Two versions of the software are provided here
- Version 1.4 in "old-style" matlab, including several scripts
- Verson 2.5 in object-oriented matlab, with only two short example scripts 

An explanation of the methods under the form of an unfinished paper "JFM_Menisci" is provided in PDFs directory. 

All this is kindly shared without any guarranty ; anyone who wants to help me continue this project is warmly thanked !
