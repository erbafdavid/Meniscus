This package allows computation of solutions of the meniscus equation
(static configurations of drops, bubbles, bridges, etc...)
through continuation method

a meniscus is defined by the four variables :
[R,Z,P,V] 
R and Z are arrays containing the points along the contour
P and V are respectively the nondimensional pressure (at Z=0) 
and the volume of the meniscus. Either can be used as a continuation
variable.

[R,Z,P,V] should always be used as argument of the function
in an indisociable way (in future versions this should be reprogramed as a structure)
 
To start :
1/ build a "guess" for (R,Z,P,V)
2/ find the closest equilibrium solution by imposing either P and V with 
Newton_P or Newton_V
3/ use the loops
4/ have fun...

NOTE ON THE GLOBAL VARIABLES
RR          radius (for pinned drops & bridges)
dpdz        nondimensional pressure gradient ( = rho g / gamma ) 
Weta        relaxation factor for newton, normal deformation (should be one in principle) 
Wxi         same for tangential stretching 
verbosity   0 to limit output ; >0 for debugging 
beta        contact angle ; negative means pinned line
discretization  "FE" for finite elements ; "FD" for finite differences
nbdim       number of dimensions of the problem (2 or 3) 
Vref        reference volume (for plots)
